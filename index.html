    <h1>How I learnt Responsive Web Development with <a href="https://freecodecamp.org">FreeCodeCamp</a> and Hosted it on <a href="https://tiiny.host">tiiny</a></h1>
    <h2>Subsection 1</h2>
    <p>A month ago, as instructed by my lecturer, I started using freecodecamp to learn responsive web development.<br>
    Though it wasn't my first time learning web development, using freecodecamp gave me the practical experience I sought. <br>
    The lessons were divided into 18 different courses. 
    <ul>
        <li>The first course was focused on introducing me, the student to HTML</li>
        <li>The next two courses introduced CSS. It tasked me to build some basic designs using css.
            <ol>
                <li>The first of the two was meant to introduce me to the basic HTML styling with CSS. </li>
                <li>The second of both then introduced me to CSS colours. It taught me the effect of CSS colouring, and how CSS colours work. </li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>The third of the 18 courses, then introduced me to basic form creation. This also introduced me to basic html formatting with CSS.</li>
        <li>After this, there was a project i had to complete. In said freecodecamp projects, the students aren't guided to create the projects, but rather given certain guidelines to complete.</li>
        <li>I was given a webpage, and was tasked to develop something that is functionally similar to the webpage given. It was a nice learning experience, as i did my best to copy the webpage as much as posssible.</li>

    </ul>

<br><br>The friends that helped me to accomplish the hosting of my worked on projects are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Myself</li>
        <li>ChatGPT</li>

<br><br>Some things i learnt from these exercises are:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>HTML is as easy as they say.</li>
        <li>CSS is much more difficult and complicated than they say.</li>
        <li>My lecturer thinks we only do his course.</li>
    </ol>
